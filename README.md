# Efaecalis_eCDF

# Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) for relative accessory gene frequencies (0.01-0.99) per each major host type.
# ECDFs are further compared using permutation tests.
# Test statistic is the maximum difference of the two ECDFs compared.
# NB when permutations are run without seed number, p-values may vary slightly from one run to another
